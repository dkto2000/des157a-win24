                    <p>My grandpa was born De Manh To and he was raised in the then Northern Vietnamese town of Thái Bình. He was the first son of a third wife and was raised in a humble estate up until his adolescence. </p>

                    <h1>1954</h1>
                    <p>This year saw my Ong Noi make the important decision of moving away from his hometown. He chose to leave for the following reasons: he saw the rise of communism in his community and didn't like it, and he wanted to attend college at a place with many job opportunities. And so he traveled to Hai Phong harbor since the Americans and French were funding boat rides to Southern Vietnam via Operation Passage to Freedom.  </p>

                    <h1>1975</h1>
                    <p>This year was a tumultuous and tragic year as my Ong Noi was taken prisoner during the aftermath of the Fall of Saigon during the end of the Vietnam War. He was sent to a reeducation camp in Hue province and was forced to do manual labor for nearly a decade. He was unfortunately not able to contact nor visit his wife or family during this period. </p>

                    <h1>1985</h1>
                    <p>This year marked a period of rebirth and refreshment as this was the year my Ong Noi was freed from his camp and allowed to go back to his family after all of these years. Ever since this year, my Ong Noi has made big steps to better my family's fortunes. He managed to bring my uncles to America for a better life and has continued to help take care of my cousins and me. Although he is a man of few words, his actions speaks volumes. </p>
