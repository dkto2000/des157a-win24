    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>I intend to update my Every Picture Project for my Final Project because I believe that the userbility, functonality, and visual design still needs to be improved</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>For this project, I want to focus primarily on the visual aspects of my webpage. Most specifically, I want to improve upon the old movie aesthetic that I currently have for my Every Picture site. Visual improvements would come in the form of a preloader loading screen that has the visuals of a old movie countdown with tape role, and a more refined grain filter to encompass the page. From the userbility side, I want to experiment more with fonts for my reading content, and add subtitles to my enlarged map portion so that people are not lost to what city is being indicated. For the functionality angle, I want to try and make a responsive redesign for my site preferably with a different js script involved for the features. </p>

    <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
    <p>For my visual design, I will be looking towards the assistance and insight from professors from other Design courses and possibly a design tutor if I am allowed the time to contact them. I will also look towards peers in the design industry for their opinions as well. </p>
