        I recently read Naema Baskanderi's article,<a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,"</a> which outlines a few good guidelines for designers such as  incorporating overlays on web pages, emphasizing their goal to highlight specific content, provide additional information, or prompt a call to action. I also learned about the importance of purposeful inclusion for effective content exhibition as one key point that was brought up  in the article was the focus on keyboard accessibility, and how that can offer further insights applicable to projects like MadLibs. Furthermore, the article also mentions how efficient performance can be conducted through avoiding overuse of proper visual hierarchy, and usability testing for feedback and improvement. Contextual cues for user attention are highlighted for enhancing usability. Finally, I learned the importance of acknowledging the annoyance of pop-ups on mobile and challenges for users with screen magnifiers, as you should always question whether pop-ups, overlays, etc., are truly necessary especially if it's a login prompt following a "log in" click.

      <h2>
        Thoughts on Form Design 
    </h2>

      I recently read the article titled <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"> Best Practices for Form Design </a> on Medium, and it highlighted several insightful points about effective form design. Let's face it, nobody likes filling out forms! Most if not all of the fill-in portions can be executed through a click or two. The article introduced new concepts to me. For instance, I discovered the importance of limiting Inline label design because users can be disoriented once the label clears upon clicking it. I also found out the importance of careful wording when it comes to giving the user feedback once they have messed up. Inputting a negative message such as "You didn't enter a name" puts unnecessary blame on them.

      I find the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup">Twitter Sign Up Page</a> to be a good example of form design because of how simplified the process is. There is a great balance of clicks and fill-ins and the warnings carry a neutral connotation.
