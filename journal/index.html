        After reading the article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a> , I learned a few interesting things regarding UI/UX choices for game design. For instance, I didn't know about the right-side rule with button choices. It all make sense now. Also, I noticed the article mentioned rewarded-video advertisements. The practice on paper makes sense, but morally ads only works to cheapen the experience as every player knows this is just a way to waste more of your time for cheap incentives like "get more gems if you watch this video". 

        Finally, I noticed a lot of the examples are mobile games that have adopted a free to play model with ads. I feel like none of the practices mentioned in this article  or very few of them really apply to games you have to pay for.I also find it insane that a lot of these examples are catered to children but I shouldn't be too surprised because kids are often able to effectively leech off their parents especially Gen Alpha good riddance!

        This is a picture of my grandpa with my dad and his brothers. This was the first photo that my uncles ever took with my grandpa as he was put in a reeducation camp for the majority of their youth. One thing I noticed that I didn't see before was that three of people in the picture have white shoes while the other two have black shoes. I found this thought to be unique because the ones who are wearing black shoes are the oldest people in the room, which are my grandpa and 2nd eldest uncle respectively. The other uncles are younger by a couple years.

      This is a picture taken by Tiffany Lui and I found it quite fascinating. At first glance I thought that the piece was made out of lego but apparently it is made of nanoblocks. The work is a reconstruction of the legendary pokemon Groudon. I think it is a great homage to the 8bit origins of the character. Every line detail is replaced with a blocky aesthetic.

        I recently came across an article titled <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills"</a> from the New York Times. It took me a moment to grasp the concept of visual thinking, a flashback to those AP history classes where they emphasized itâ€”hello, political cartoons! The images discussed were a great exercise for honing analysis skills, with Image 1 particularly catching my eye; its mix of vehicles and lack of traditional roads suggested a race to me. Another site worth mentioning is the One Day in My World project, impressively using images and interactivity to share the stories of various communities. As you scroll, you delve deeper into their worlds, learning about the challenges they confront.

        I recently read Naema Baskanderi's article,<a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,"</a> which outlines a few good guidelines for designers such as  incorporating overlays on web pages, emphasizing their goal to highlight specific content, provide additional information, or prompt a call to action. I also learned about the importance of purposeful inclusion for effective content exhibition as one key point that was brought up  in the article was the focus on keyboard accessibility, and how that can offer further insights applicable to projects like MadLibs. Furthermore, the article also mentions how efficient performance can be conducted through avoiding overuse of proper visual hierarchy, and usability testing for feedback and improvement. Contextual cues for user attention are highlighted for enhancing usability. Finally, I learned the importance of acknowledging the annoyance of pop-ups on mobile and challenges for users with screen magnifiers, as you should always question whether pop-ups, overlays, etc., are truly necessary especially if it's a login prompt following a "log in" click.

      I recently read the article titled <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"> Best Practices for Form Design </a> on Medium, and it highlighted several insightful points about effective form design. Let's face it, nobody likes filling out forms! Most if not all of the fill-in portions can be executed through a click or two. The article introduced new concepts to me. For instance, I discovered the importance of limiting Inline label design because users can be disoriented once the label clears upon clicking it. I also found out the importance of careful wording when it comes to giving the user feedback once they have messed up. Inputting a negative message such as "You didn't enter a name" puts unnecessary blame on them.
    </p>
      
      <p>
      I find the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup">Twitter Sign Up Page</a> to be a good example of form design because of how simplified the process is. There is a great balance of clicks and fill-ins and the warnings carry a neutral connotation.
